Okay. It's time I let you know something vitally important:



  The time machine doesn't send you back in time

  It creates a clone of yourself in the past

  Every clone is temporary, and exists only up until the moment
  that the time machine was used to create it



Take a brief moment to wrap your head around that,
  then carry on
